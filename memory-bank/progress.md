## Project Setup

**Date:** 2026-01-12

**Entry:** Project initialization and memory bank creation

### Actions Completed

- Created `CLAUDE.md` with project guidance for future Claude instances
- Created `memory-bank/` folder structure for long-term project memory
- Initialized all memory bank files:
  - `game-design-document.md` — Core design vision extracted from existing docs
  - `tech-stack.md` — Placeholder for future tech decisions
  - `implementation-plan.md` — High-level phases outlined
  - `architecture.md` — Tentative component ideas documented
  - `progress.md` — This file, for tracking development history

### Current State

- **Phase:** Pre-planning / Documentation
- **Status:** Greenfield project with no code implemented
- **Next Step:** Enter PLAN MODE (per project-identity.md instruction)

### Design Foundation Established

From existing documentation (`project-identity.md`, `game-design-document.md`):

- Core feeling: Tension, doubt, regret
- Game fantasy: Final voter choosing among 5 candidates
- Creative principles: Dialogue as gameplay, ambiguity intentional
- Success metric: How much player doubts their certainty
- Vibe-first approach: Emotion over mechanics
