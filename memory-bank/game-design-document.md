# Game Design Document — The Last Vote

> This file captures the core design vision for the game. It serves as the single source of truth for all creative and design decisions.

## Core Feeling

The player should feel:

- **Uncertain** — Nothing is clear, everything is ambiguous
- **Slightly anxious** — The stakes feel real, even in a fictional setting
- **Clever at first, doubtful later** — Initial confidence erodes as consequences unfold
- **Regretful, reflective, or unsettled** — The experience lingers after the choice is made

The game should make the player think:

> "I trusted the wrong person — and I don't know why."

## Game Fantasy

You are the final voter in a fictional town.

Five candidates stand before you. They speak calmly, confidently, and persuasively.

Some of them lie.
Some of them tell the truth.
None of them reveal everything.

You may ask only a few questions.
After that, your vote is final.

## Target Players

- Fans of dialogue-driven and psychological games
- Players who enjoy social deduction and mind games
- Streamers and content creators (reaction-based experiences)
- People curious about persuasion and human behavior
- Players who enjoy short games with strong aftertaste

## Project Goals

Create a complete, playable browser-based game that:

- Revolves around **conversation, not mechanics**
- Challenges **judgment instead of skill**
- Is **short (one sitting) but replayable**
- Encourages **reflection and discussion**

### Success Metric

Success is NOT measured by winning.

Success is measured by **how much the player doubts their own certainty**.

---

## Creative Principles

- **Dialogue is the gameplay**
- Lies should sound reasonable
- Truth should not feel safe
- There is no perfect strategy
- Ambiguity is intentional

### What to Avoid

- Clear "good vs bad" characters
- Obvious tells or visual cues
- Mechanical optimization
- Over-explaining outcomes

---

## What Makes It Different

- AI characters that can lie convincingly
- No objective "correct" choice
- Focus on interpretation, not facts
- A short experience with long-lasting impact

## Why This Game Should Exist

The Last Vote explores how people make irreversible decisions with limited information and misplaced confidence.

It turns a familiar social ritual into a personal psychological test.
