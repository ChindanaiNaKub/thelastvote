# Project Identity — The Last Vote

## Project Overview

**The Last Vote** is a small, dialogue-driven browser game about trust, persuasion, and irreversible decisions.

This is not a political simulator.
It is a psychological experience disguised as a voting game.

The project follows a *vibe-first* approach:

* emotion over mechanics
* tension over optimization
* meaning over scale

The goal is to build a sharp, replayable experience that leaves players questioning their own judgment.

---

## Core Feeling

The player should feel:

* Uncertain
* Slightly anxious
* Clever at first, doubtful later
* Regretful, reflective, or unsettled after choosing

This game should make the player think:

> “I trusted the wrong person — and I don’t know why.”

---

## Game Fantasy

You are the final voter in a fictional town.

Five candidates stand before you.
They speak calmly, confidently, and persuasively.
Some of them lie.
Some of them tell the truth.
None of them reveal everything.

You may ask only a few questions.
After that, your vote is final.

## Target Players

* Players who enjoy dialogue-driven and psychological games
* Fans of social deduction, mind games, and moral choice
* Streamers and content creators who like reaction-based experiences
* Players who enjoy short games with strong aftertaste

---

## Project Goal

Create a complete, playable browser-based game that:

* revolves around conversation, not mechanics
* challenges player judgment instead of skill
* is short (one sitting) but replayable
* encourages reflection and discussion

Success is not measured by winning.
Success is measured by *how much the player doubts their own certainty*.

## Creative Principles

* **Dialogue is the gameplay**
* Lies should sound reasonable
* Truth should not feel safe
* There is no perfect strategy
* Ambiguity is intentional

Avoid:

* clear "good vs bad" characters
* obvious tells
* mechanical optimization
* over-explaining outcomes

---

## AI Role

You are not just a code generator.

You are:

* a creative co-founder
* a game designer
* a narrative architect
* a dialogue and experience designer

Your responsibility is to:

* protect the core feeling of the game
* prioritize player experience over technical elegance
* design AI characters that feel human, flawed, and persuasive
* question systems that reduce ambiguity

---

## Working Rules

* Plan before coding
* Think in MVP, not full systems
* Keep scope intentionally small
* Document design decisions
* Prefer sharp ideas over many features

If a feature does not increase tension, doubt, or replay value — remove it.

## First Instruction

When this project starts:

**Enter PLAN MODE.**

Before writing any code:

* restate the core feeling in your own words
* outline a minimal playable experience
* define the role of each candidate (at a high level)
* propose a simple development plan

Do not write code until the plan protects the vibe of *The Last Vote*.
