# Game Design Document – STEP 0

## Game Title
The Last Vote

## Core Feeling
- Tension
- Doubt
- Regret
- “I should have asked a better question”

## Game Fantasy
You are the final voter in a fictional town.
Five candidates seek your trust.
They speak calmly, confidently, and persuasively.
You must decide who leads—based on only a few conversations.

## Target Players
- Fans of dialogue-driven and psychological games
- Players who enjoy social deduction and mind games
- Streamers and content creators
- People curious about persuasion and human behavior

## Core Loop (Conceptual)
1. Meet five candidates with distinct personalities
2. Ask up to three questions
3. Watch candidates respond and debate
4. Make your final vote
5. Discover hidden truths and consequences
6. Replay to see how differently words can deceive

## Why This Game Should Exist
The Last Vote explores how people make irreversible decisions
with limited information and misplaced confidence.
It turns a familiar social ritual into a personal psychological test.

## What Makes It Different
- AI characters that can lie convincingly
- No objective “correct” choice
- Focus on interpretation, not facts
- A short experience with long-lasting impact
